# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## The Task

Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit you as a full-stack web developer.

Because this application won’t be deployed, I'll provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality. 

## User Story
